## Overview
This project is the precursor for other full stack projects in the future. It will stand as the introduction to CSS Frameworks and the engineer will learn through building small components of the most common website items to get practice.

## Context 
The website is the ‚Äústore front‚Äù for one‚Äôs business. An online presence is required by almost *every* company. This will grow exponentially when the crypto and metaverse start to come out. But there is NO SLOWING down the importance of being able to make great responsive websites.

This project combats that problem by forcing me to get good practice in creating small components that are a part of the main CSS Frameworks. For example, most websites have ‚Äúsome‚Äù type of navigation that is important to learn how to implement like the back of my hand! 

Fight to get over the hump!

This is important foundation for the future solutions that I plan to build. As plenty of the things that I‚Äôve wanted to do have had a website component in them.

## Goals
The goal of this project is to provide myself with the knowledge and experience of implementing common features of websites in the most popular CSS Frameworks. Listed below are the goals of what we are making and the CSS Frameworks that will be used to make each item.

- Pick a good website and re-create an item.
- Use the current CSS Framework‚Äôs docs to identify items to re-create and find websites that have that item and re-create.

### Common CSS
- Buttons
- Lists
- Image Grids
- Code
- Forms
    - Form Logic
- Grid systems
- Print media styles
- Tables
- Typography

### Utilities
- Basic utilities
- Responsive utilities

### Components
- Badges
- Input Groups
- Labels
- Nav Bars + Hamburger Menu + Drop-down Menus
- Sidebar
- Navbars
- Navs
- Pager
- Pagination

### JavaScript Components
- Dropdowns
- Modals
- Popovers
- Tooltips
- Landing Pages
- Multipage Applications

I will pick out components from websites that perform well and replicate it.

- This is to force myself to have good design practices and create real items instead of just simple ‚ÄúHello World / Todo‚Äù items

This will be repeated for all components until completion.

- For instance, if an item was Navbars. I would first put it in High-level Design. Associate the task with proper milestone and THEN starting working on the task.
    - The goal is to be clear on what completion looks like.

üí° For organization purposes... everything that shows up in Milestones was first planned for here in it‚Äôs respective toggle.
